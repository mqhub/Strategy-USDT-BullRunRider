# Contributing

We are thrilled you are interested in contributing to this repository. Your help may be essential to the project's success and we want you in! 

Superalgos is a collective project, currently at a very early stage. We not only welcome contributions but may even choose to incentivize relevant contributions via the project's native crypto token.

Please read the [Join the Dev Team]( https://superalgos.org/developers-join-dev-team.shtml) page in our website to learn more about how you may become a relevant member of the Community and even make a living out of contributing code to the project.

Contributions are deemed _voluntary work_, irrespective of the incentives that may be in place, and are subject to the conditions described in the LICENSE
